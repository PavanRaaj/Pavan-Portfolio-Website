        I am very Passionate about coding and solving problems.I
        usually keep my ecosystem filled with humor and joy. I am naturally an
        introvert, but if I get connected with people and start working I can
        produce miracles. Coming to the technical field, I know how to code in 8 Programming 
        languages. I've done a project using front end within 100 days. I‘ve also done a mini 
        project(Todo App) and a final project(Drive it) using Ruby on Rails. Since 
        I’ve learned Ruby on Rails myself within two months, I am confident to say I 
        can learn any new language given to me.
